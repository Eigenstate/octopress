After many years of ignoring my Wordpress blog, I have finally migrated it to my domain.
This will probably mess up my accidental SEO (I had the #1 hit on Google for "repair ipod
database linux"), but is much, much more maintainable and hopefully accessible too.

I really hate web design, so I used [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) as the overall
framework for the website. Octopress is built on [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com), a framework
for creating static content-aware sites. In theory to add a new post I just write some markdown.

I created the site theme myself. The blurb at the top is a modified version of ShinyToyLabs'
[jargon generator](http://shinytoylabs.com/jargon/) which I think is hilarious. I will put more
science words in there soon.

For the curious, my domain name is from [NameCheap](http://www.namecheap.com), and the hosting 
is on [NearlyFreeSpeech](http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net). I love them for hosting because they
are super cheap, and have great docs.
