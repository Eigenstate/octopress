## About

I graduated from UC San Diego in March 2014 with a major in **Bioinformatics** and a **minor in Mathematics**. I am currently working at the San Diego Supercomputer Center and will begin a doctoral program in biophysics in the fall at Stanford University.

I have done computational chemistry at the **San Diego Supercomputer Center** as part of the [**Walker Molecular Dynamics Lab**](http://www.wmd-lab.org) since 2011. I have also worked at **Pfizer**, the **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration** and the UCSD **Experimental Game Lab**.

I am interested in the mechanics of life at the molecular level, and am especially fascinated by **protein dynamics** and interaction. I believe that today's computers are an extremely powerful tool that can give unique insights into complex biological systems. I use **molecular dynamics** simulations to examine how proteins behave,  and also help develop and **[improve parameters](projects.html)** used in simulations. I'm also very interested in ways of **mitigating and detecting error** in these simulations, especially with highly-parallel code.

I know **C++**, **C**, **Perl**, **Java**, **LaTeX**, and **BASH** very well. I am comfortable with FORTRAN, mySQL, and Python. I have enough knowledge of HTML, Javascript, and CSS to make this website. I like parallel programming with **MPI** and **OpenMP**, and I really like working with GPU-accelerated code written in **CUDA**.

In my free time, I like to work on **open-source** projects and play around with Linux. I also hike, bicycle, and **dance** (all kinds) through classes and with friends. On weekends you can usually find me **reading**, sewing, or doing math outside.
